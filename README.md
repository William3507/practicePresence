# practicePresence
A practice app designed to practice using the FlyBuy SDK

Specifically this app connects using the FlyBuy SDK to presence gateways. 

The user is able to input their name and then turn on and off the locator. When turned on, their phone connects via bluetooth to the FlyBuy gateways
allowing the phone's location to then be tracked.

While my app is relatively basic, it was mainly created to help go through the FlyBuy documentation and to help myself get more familiar with Swift.
